# CloudSim Experiment 1: Basic Datacenter and Cloudlet Simulation

This experiment demonstrates a basic CloudSim simulation where a single datacenter hosts one virtual machine (VM) that executes a single cloudlet. It is intended as an introductory example to understand CloudSim concepts such as datacenters, brokers, VMs, and cloudlets.

---

## 📌 Experiment Objective

- Create a datacenter with one host
- Deploy a single virtual machine (VM)
- Submit one cloudlet for execution
- Run the CloudSim simulation
- Display cloudlet execution results

---

## 🛠 Dependencies Required

To run this experiment, you need the following:

- **Java JDK** (Java 8 or above recommended)
- **CloudSim Toolkit** (version compatible with your code, e.g., CloudSim 3.x / CloudSim Plus as applicable)
- **Apache Maven** (optional, if managing dependencies via Maven)
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code)
